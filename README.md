# Healthcare Application E-Portfolio
A modern portfolio to showcase my Healthcare Application Project and to document my skills and experience. This website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, highlighting my work in both Mobile Application Development and Full Stack Web Development. A clean interface was utilised, aligning with the themes of my Mobile Application through Ant-Design for components and Webpack for efficient bundling.
